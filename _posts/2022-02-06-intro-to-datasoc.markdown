## What is the UCC DataSoc
UCC DataSoc, short for the Data and Analytics Society, was founded in 2020 making it one of the newest societies in UCC.
The society focuses on applications of Data Science and Analytics to various fields. In the past the society has held talks with data scientists, data science competitions, collaborations with other societies and social events to promote the society itself.
